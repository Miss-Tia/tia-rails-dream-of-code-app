# Q3: - Description:

# Peace of Mind (POM): Grow Where You Are Planted is a journaling, gardening, and tracking application focused on emotional wellness, internal reflection, and nurturing routines like gardening and cooking. It’s designed for individuals such as moms with grown children, or anyone else who may be rediscovering themselves and on a journey towards building a life centered around peace, intention, and creativity. 

# Allows users to track what/when/why they plant in their garden, log personal reflections(wins/struggles/gratitude/random thoughts), and save meaningful recipes. Also a feature to respond to shadow work writing prompts for deep emotional self-exploration.
